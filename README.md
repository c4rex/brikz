Bring hands-on interactive learning to your children with Brikz the gamified Duplo education app.

## Why this app?

During the lock-down kids between 3-5 years old were not able to go to school and participate in their early learning programs. 
Missing out on vital skills that they need to learn at that age like:
- Fine motor skills
- Imagination
- Creativity
- Colors
- Memory
- Counting
- Technology

The app guides your child through a set of levels and stages they need to complete, interacting with Duplo and technology like mobile phones or tablets in a fun and challenging way to improve their skills.
