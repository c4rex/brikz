Bring hands-on interactive learning to your children with Brikz the gamified Duplo education app.

## Why this app?

During the lock-down kids between 3-5 years old were not able to go to school and participate in their early learning programs. 
Missing out on vital skills that they need to learn at that age like:

-  Fine motor skills
-  Imagination
-  Creativity
-  Colors
-  Memory
-  Counting
-  Technology

The app guides your child through a set of levels and stages they need to complete, interacting with Duplo and technology like mobile phones or tablets in a fun and challenging way to improve their skills.


## Best of both worlds

We created an unique concept where children (and parents, teachers ) get to blend the physical world with a mobile application using an innovative technology called Augmented Reality to combine both.


## Game synopsis
As a player I enter challenge mode, where you can choose between educational topics such as colors, shapes, animals that can foster a discussion between child and parent (or teacher).

Once the topic is selected, for example: "Colors", the player is presented with stages, in each stage the player is given a set of bricks, from which he can build something the only thing is the player doesn't know yet, once the player presses  "Let's build!"  the player gets presented a randomized build plan, 

once the player has memorized the object he can press "start"  a countdown timer  is presented if it reaches zero the game is over, each build plan can have different times depending on the difficulty, once the player presses "Finished building" , an augmented reality camera point of view opens, the players have to point his constructed object in to the camera, when the object gets recognized the stage is complete, points are awarded by calculating level x stage x time remaining. 

The points will be saved for each level and stage and can be viewed in a leaderboard to compare your score to the high score, by completing a stage you open up the previous locked stage until all of them are unlocked to open up the next level.


## Saving business by creating a market

- Duplo lost its patent in 1989 allowing anyone to manufacture their own “Brikz” that can be sold through the app.
- Stuck? need to advance? buy your way to the next level with an in-app purchase.
- Stimulating direct and indirect sales of Duplo, Mega Blocks and other clones through in-app advertisements.
